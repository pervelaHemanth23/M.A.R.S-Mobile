## VERSIONS

### M.A.R.S Prototype
*(Uploaded on 06/11/24)*

### Key Features
1. The game is made using URP (Universal Render pipeline). My first time using it.
2. Added Custom Terrain and Spaceship Models
3. Levels and Platforms based progression. Die in between the platforms and the Level starts from the beginning. Level is like a checkpoint where you respawn from.
4. Added Cameras that frame the action and platforms properly.
5. Creatively placed lights to guide the player
6. First time working on shaders. Created a cartoon water shader.
